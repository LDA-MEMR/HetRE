# HetRE: Heterogeneous random effects covariance matrix

This repository contains code to implement the methodology discussed in "A heterogeneous random effects covariance matrix in longitudinal data with missing responses and mismeasured covariates" by Erfanul Hoque, Mahmoud Torabi and Elif Acar.

The folder `src` contains all functions (.R) requires to implement the methods, and the folder `test` provides scripts to implement the methods with simulated data.

## First time only: Setting up the directory

To start you need to open the project file (LDvine.Rproj) in RStudio which will bring RStudio to the root directory.
