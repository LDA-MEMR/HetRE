# HetRE: Heterogeneous random effects covariance matrix

This repository contains code to implement the methodology discussed in "A heterogeneous random effects covariance matrix in longitudinal data with missing responses and mismeasured covariates" by Erfanul Hoque, Mahmoud Torabi and Elif Acar.

**Hoque, M. E., Torabi, M., and Acar, E. F. (2022). A heterogeneous random effects covariance matrix in longitudinal data with missing responses and mismeasured covariates.**

The folder `src` contains all functions (.R) requires to implement the methods, and the folder `test` provides scripts to implement the methods with simulated data.
